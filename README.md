This is some rust code I threw together to learn about allegro.

It displays a koch dragon in slowly shifting rainbow colors.

To build it, just clone the repo, run
```cargo build```
and then run the executable output in the 'target' directory.

It's not very interesting but it was a fun learning experience. I have some
other projects that need my attention but I'd like to add loadable l-systems,
the ability to automatically scale the output, and perhaps some sliders with
fun parameters. For now, though, it's an artifact of a fun weekend spent
playing with math+art+code.
